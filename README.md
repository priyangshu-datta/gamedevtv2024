# GameDev.tv Game Jam 2024

This repository tracks my progress in the game jam. The main concepts of the game are continuously added in the ideas.txt, for now.

I am using [pygame](https://pyga.me/). The credits for the sprites used are in the respective folder.

The program should be started as follows:
```sh
python main.py
```

Libraries used:
- Loguru - for logging
- PyGame - for game development

For world creation, I have used [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/).
